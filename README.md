## Task

Create TODO list in Laravel framework

## Instalation & Run

## PHP

PHP 8.3.8

### Docker

Running docker via Laravel Sail https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/installation#docker-installation-using-sail

## Solution

I created simple CRUD page with test using PEST.

Clean time of work is around 10 hours, mostly reading and looking for specific things in documentation.

I used soft deletes, because I am used to keep data for not causing errors due to missing relationshops.

### Week places

Things I believe every project should have or things that I consider basics.

- Delete is done over GET not DELETE method
- No dynamic table sorting 
- No git project check for pull requests
